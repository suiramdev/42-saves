> This repository was created for my own use.

During the piscine¹, the staff likes to do what we call a "randominette" : They choose randomly someone to wipe out his computer.
<br />So, I made this git repository that contains my piscine exercices, in case I lose everything.
<br />It also contains a panic shell script so I can save everything from anywhere in the terminal.

¹ _Piscine is the name of the pre-registration exam I enrolled in Sep. 2022, from the 42 school at Paris._
